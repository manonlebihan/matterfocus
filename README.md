# Matterfocus - A plugin to focus easily

Matter Focus is a plug-in for Mattermost, a self-hosted open-source instant messaging software and service. It is designed as an internal chat for organizations and businesses and is presented as an alternative to Slack.

Matterfocus is a plug-in that brings together several features to improve communication, productivity, and time saving within a company or school. We know that communication is not the easiest key to obtain in an institution and thanks to this plug-in it will be. The different functionalities that we can find in the first place are: 
**Focus mode:** 
We have seen that notifications are becoming more and more important and that they will increase, so in the working world it will be very important to manage them.  The focus mode will allow to plan time slots according to our activities, meaning whom and when, to increase productivity. It would also allow to mute the other chats, not to be disturbed while working. 
**Prioritization of the notification system:** 
For a more efficient messaging system it is necessary to be able to make it attractive, therefore the work notifications must be judged by their importance in an instantaneous way. The sender of the message will categorize its message so that the receiver can now if it is an important matter or can be viewed later on according to its priorities.  categorization of notifications:  
    **Red** : Emergency 
    **Yellow** : important
    **Green** : minor
Classification of notifications through a sorting center: the purpose of this classification is to be able to center all our messages in the same place by being able to prioritize them without scrolling a very long news feed so as not to miss important information.
